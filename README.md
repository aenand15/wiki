# Wiki
This wiki was designed in ruby using sinatra and the rails framework. All html and css was done by a fellow student. The site allows users to post about local events. It is protected to allow those with accounts authorized by the admin to edit. The admin has special privileges as well. To see the admin controls login with the username "Admin" and password "Password".
